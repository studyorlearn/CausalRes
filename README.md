The CausalRes algorithm is a method for diagnosing intermittent open circuit faults in inverter IGBTs. It builds a neural network model based on the PyTorch library.
In this algorithm, the neural network model first receives the data input from the inverter IGBT. Then, through the processing of input data and feature extraction, the model can learn the feature patterns in the case of intermittent open-circuit faults. In this way, the model can learn to identify and detect intermittent open-circuit faults in the inverter IGBT.
Specifically, the CausalRes algorithm uses the CausalResNet architecture, which is a network structure based on the Residual Network (ResNet). The model extracts features from time series data by using time convolution and residual joining. This helps to capture the transient behavior of an inverter IGBT open circuit fault.
Using the PyTorch library makes it easier and more efficient to build and train neural network models. PyTorch is an open-source Python-based deep learning framework that provides a rich set of tools and functions to easily build and train various neural network models.
By using the CausalRes algorithm and the PyTorch library, we can effectively diagnose intermittent open-circuit faults in inverter IGBTs, which is essential to ensure the normal operation of the inverter and improve the reliability of the system. ...
